## **üõ† System Details & Issue Summary**
### **SQL FILE LOCATION**  
üìÇ `C:\Users\j.fuller\source\Workspaces\Workspace\Repo\Web Applications\Terminal\Terminal\SQL\JobTypesDatabase.sql`

### **Issues to Address**
1. Overall functionality

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deep-Dive Workflow Analysis**
### **üîé Step 1: Identify and Restate Issues**
- Restate the issues to confirm understanding.
- Clearly describe expected behavior and how it differs from the current implementation.
- Identify potential areas of concern or root causes before proceeding.

### **üîó Step 2: Full Workflow Breakdown**
Perform an **end-to-end review** of the workflow, ensuring all **related functions, views, and SQL queries** are documented.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ View Layer (UI)**
- Identify all buttons, input fields, modals, and JavaScript interactions.
- Review how user actions trigger controller methods.
- Ensure proper API calls and request handling.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Controller Layer**
- List all controller methods handling the UI interaction.
- Analyze how parameters are passed, validated, and transformed.
- Identify dependencies on models, services, and helper methods.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Model & Business Logic**
- Identify how job types are retrieved, modified, and stored.
- Ensure validation and business logic are correctly applied.
- Check for redundant or inefficient processing.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ SQL & Database Layer**
- Identify all SQL queries related to JobType.
- Validate query performance and indexing.
- Ensure queries follow security best practices.
- Verify proper transaction handling.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Output & Response Handling**
- Inspect how data is returned to the UI.
- Validate formatting and correctness of API responses.
- Ensure error handling is properly implemented.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Function-Level Review**
Each function must be analyzed based on:

### **üìå General Function Structure**
- Identify the function name, location, and purpose.
- Analyze the function signature, expected parameters, and return values.

### **üìå Input Handling**
- Identify input sources and validation logic.
- Check for security vulnerabilities.

### **üìå Logic & Processing**
- Evaluate conditionals, loops, and transformations.
- Ensure proper application of business rules.
- Review error handling and exception management.

### **üìå Dependencies & Integration**
- Identify calls to services, APIs, and database functions.
- Ensure compatibility with related modules.

### **üìå Output Handling**
- Ensure return values are structured correctly.
- Check for unintended side effects.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Review and Refactoring**
Each SQL operation must be reviewed for:

- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure indexing and query efficiency.
- **Security Compliance**: Validate sanitization and parameterization.
- **Transactional Safety**: Implement rollback mechanisms as needed.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Prevent deadlocks and locking issues.

All stored procedures must follow these guidelines:
- **Use a single stored procedure** for `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` operations to limit redundancy.
- **Prefix stored procedure names with `JobType_sp`** for consistency.
- **Ensure stored procedure names are descriptive** and clearly indicate functionality.
- **Modify only the SQL file (`JobTypesDatabase.sql`)** without executing any queries.
- **Use transactions for data integrity and rollback protection**.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Identification & Root Cause Analysis**
For every **function, controller, view, and SQL query**:
- Identify inefficiencies, redundant logic, or missing validations.
- Detect security flaws such as unvalidated inputs or unsafe queries.
- Find incorrect calculations, business logic errors, or race conditions.
- Highlight unused, duplicated, or outdated code.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Action Plan Creation**
### **üìå Deliver a Structured Action Plan**
- Summarize all necessary changes, structured by:
  - UI (View Layer)
  - Controller Methods
  - Model Functions
  - SQL Queries
- Define exact modifications required while ensuring minimal disruption.
- Explain how each change improves performance, maintainability, or security.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Action Plan & Apply Changes**
After creating the action plan, execute the changes **without excessive code output**:

1. **Modify only relevant files** in:
   - View (UI)
   - Controller
   - Models
   - SQL Queries

2. **Summarize changes made**, without displaying the full code.

3. **List affected files and functions**.

4. **Verify changes** to ensure:
   - UI correctly interacts with the controller.
   - API properly updates JobType records.
   - Database modifications are safe and performant.

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Deployment Plan**
### **‚úÖ Unit Testing**
- Validate each modified function against expected behavior.
- Test with valid, invalid, and edge-case inputs.

### **‚úÖ Integration Testing**
- Verify end-to-end workflow between UI, controller, model, and database.
- Ensure seamless data updates and retrieval.

### **‚úÖ Performance Testing**
- Check for improvements in query execution.
- Measure response times before and after updates.

### **‚úÖ Security Review**
- Validate input sanitization and parameterization.
- Ensure no risks of SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF vulnerabilities.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Single Integrated Response Requirement**
- **Create a structured action plan first** before making modifications.
- **Execute the plan step-by-step**, applying necessary changes without excessive code output.
- **Modify only the SQL file (`JobTypesDatabase.sql`)** without executing queries.
- **Ensure all modifications work correctly** before finalizing.
- **The response should be complete and self-contained**, requiring no follow-up.

## **üîç Summary**
This prompt ensures:
‚úÖ **Comprehensive function-by-function and SQL review**  
‚úÖ **Structured action plan before execution**  
‚úÖ **Minimal code output, focusing on applied changes**  
‚úÖ **Full execution of planned updates in a single response**
