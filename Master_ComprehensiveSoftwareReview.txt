## **üîß Comprehensive Action Plan and Execution**

Rather than just creating a plan, you must analyze the system, develop an action plan, AND execute that plan in a single response. Your execution should include creating tests, building the test project, and running diagnostics.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Immediate Log Analysis and Error Identification**
Perform these actions immediately:

- Query the log table `[LogDB].[dbo].[Log]` for errors and exceptions
- Extract specific error patterns and stack traces
- Correlate errors with application components and workflows
- Prepare SQL queries to analyze error frequency, timing, and patterns
- Generate summary of critical errors found

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Resolution Execution**
Take these immediate actions to address identified issues:

- Write and execute diagnostic queries for each identified issue
- Create diagnostic test procedures for each issue category
- Implement specialized tests that reproduce the issues
- Execute verification procedures to confirm issue reproduction
- Prioritize immediate fixes based on severity and impact
- Implement solutions for high-priority issues first

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Implementation and Execution**
Perform these implementation steps:

- Create test project(s) for required test types
- Configure project references and dependencies
- Implement test cases for critical issues and workflows
- Add diagnostic logging verification to test cases
- Configure automatic test discovery and execution
- Build and run the test project to verify implementation
- Debug test failures and refine test cases

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Error Debugging Procedures**
Execute these debugging procedures:

- Query the log database to extract detailed error context
- Analyze stack traces and error details from the logs
- Create targeted debugging scenarios based on log findings
- Execute debugging sessions with appropriate diagnostic logging
- Capture and analyze test outputs for resolution verification
- Document successful reproductions and fixes

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Test Execution**
Implement and run automated testing:

- Configure continuous test execution for new tests
- Set up automatic error detection and reporting
- Create test data sets based on production scenarios
- Execute parameterized tests across varying conditions
- Generate test result reports with detailed diagnostics
- Validate that tests correctly identify and verify issues

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Execution Requirements**

- **Execute Log Analysis Immediately** using the provided log location
- **Create and Run Tests** that reproduce reported issues
- **Build and Debug the Test Project** to verify test functionality
- **Implement Actual Solutions** rather than just recommendations
- **Document Execution Results** including both successes and failures
- **Prioritize Actual Issue Resolution** over comprehensive analysis
- **Verify All Implemented Solutions** through testing and log analysis

## **üìù Response Requirements**

Your response MUST:

1. **Execute the complete analysis and implementation in a single response** without deferring actions
2. **Begin by querying and analyzing the log table** `[LogDB].[dbo].[Log]` for errors
3. **Address each issue in the "ISSUES:" section** with concrete implementation steps
4. **Create actual test implementations** rather than just suggesting test approaches
5. **Build and execute the test project** to verify functionality
6. **Debug any failures** using log analysis and diagnostics
7. **Implement fixes for identified issues** based on testing results
8. **Document all actions taken and their results** in a comprehensive report
9. **Provide the SQL queries used** for log analysis and error investigation
10. **Present a complete, self-contained solution** that shows both plan and execution

When addressing the application and reported issues, DO NOT simply provide recommendations - instead, implement solutions directly by creating tests, building them, executing diagnostics, and verifying results through log analysis in the `[LogDB].[dbo].[Log]` table.
