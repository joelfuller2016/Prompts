## **üîç Serilog Logging Implementation**

When implementing or reviewing logging solutions, prioritize structured logging with Serilog to capture comprehensive application telemetry:

### **Standard Serilog SQL Server Configuration**

```csharp
_logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo
    .MSSqlServer
    (
        ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["LogDb"].ConnectionString,
        "Logs",
        Serilog.Events.LogEventLevel.Debug,
        autoCreateSqlTable: true
    )
    .CreateLogger();
```

### **Log Table Schema Structure**
Review the existing log table structure to ensure it captures necessary context for performance and security monitoring:

```sql
SELECT TOP (1000) [Id]
      ,[Date]
      ,[Thread]
      ,[Level]
      ,[Logger]
      ,[ProcessID]
      ,[Version]
      ,[NestedContext]
      ,[Line]
      ,[Message]
      ,[Exception]
      ,[HostName]
      ,[NetworkUser]
      ,[AppUser]
      ,[CustNo]
      ,[PciJob]
      ,[ImbSeq]
      ,[WIPRecordId]
      ,[TransmissionId]
      ,[FileId]
      ,[JobGroupId]
      ,[ReviewedDisposition]
      ,[Reason]
      ,[CompanyID]
  FROM [LogDB].[dbo].[Log]
```

### **Logging Best Practices to Evaluate**

1. **Log Level Configuration**
   - Use Information level for production, Debug for troubleshooting
   - Configure sink-specific log levels to minimize overhead

2. **Contextual Enrichers**
   - Implement enrichers for user context, request IDs, and application metadata
   - Add business context identifiers (e.g., TransmissionId, JobGroupId)
   
3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use asynchronous logging where appropriate
   - Implement log batching for high-volume scenarios
   - Monitor SQL logging impact on database performance

4. **Security-Focused Logging**
   - Log security events at Warning or Error level
   - Ensure PII/sensitive data is properly masked or excluded
   - Log authentication events, authorization failures, and data access attempts
