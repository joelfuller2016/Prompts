## **üîç Analysis Framework**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Architecture Review**
Conduct a thorough examination of the codebase's architecture:

- **Project Structure Analysis**
  - Review folder organization and module boundaries
  - Evaluate separation of concerns and logical grouping
  - Assess naming conventions and consistency

- **Dependency Analysis**
  - Map all internal and external dependencies
  - Identify circular dependencies and tight coupling
  - Evaluate dependency injection patterns and implementation

- **Design Pattern Evaluation**
  - Identify implemented design patterns
  - Assess appropriateness of pattern selection
  - Recommend pattern adjustments or alternatives
  
- **Interface Boundary Analysis**
  - Review public interfaces between modules
  - Evaluate API design, consistency, and documentation
  - Assess backward compatibility considerations

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Quality Assessment**

For every significant component:

- **Quantitative Metrics**
  - Cyclomatic complexity assessment
  - Coupling and cohesion measurement
  - Class and method size evaluation
  - Code duplication detection

- **Qualitative Assessment**
  - Readability and maintainability evaluation
  - Naming clarity and consistency
  - Documentation completeness and accuracy
  - Error handling robustness

- **Testing Coverage Analysis**
  - Identify testing gaps and risks
  - Evaluate test quality and effectiveness
  - Assess test maintainability
  - Determine if new test projects are needed
  - Evaluate testability of current code structure
  - Recommend test implementation approaches for untested components
  - Identify critical test scenarios to prioritize

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Debt Identification**

- **Legacy Code Assessment**
  - Identify outdated patterns or technologies
  - Evaluate risk of obsolescence
  - Assess maintenance burden

- **Refactoring Opportunity Prioritization**
  - Identify high-impact, low-risk refactoring targets
  - Evaluate cost/benefit of potential refactorings
  - Prioritize based on business impact and technical risk

- **Scalability and Performance Bottlenecks**
  - Identify potential scaling limitations
  - Assess algorithmic efficiency
  - Evaluate resource utilization patterns

## **üîß Refactoring Strategy Development**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritized Refactoring Plan**
Create a strategic refactoring roadmap:

- Categorize refactoring opportunities by risk, effort, and impact
- Sequence refactorings to minimize destabilization
- Define clear success criteria for each refactoring

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Strategy**
Ensure refactoring safety through comprehensive testing:

- Define test coverage requirements before refactoring
- Recommend test improvements where coverage is insufficient
- Suggest appropriate test approaches (unit, integration, characterization)
- Create test project templates and test examples if necessary
- Establish test data and mock object requirements
- Define monitoring metrics to validate refactoring success

- **Test Project Configuration**
  - Update project files (.csproj, .vbproj, package.json, etc.) with correct settings
  - Configure appropriate framework references and package dependencies
  - Set up proper build configurations that match production environments
  - Ensure correct assembly references for components under test
  - Add necessary tool and analyzer packages for test quality
  - Configure output paths and assembly naming conventions
  - Include the test projects in solution files with proper dependencies
  - Set up continuous integration build steps for the test projects

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Approach**
Provide tactical guidance for implementation:

- Break refactorings into manageable, atomic changes
- Define clear verification steps between changes
- Recommend specific refactoring techniques for each change
